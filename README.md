🌐 Project Overview: Sales Data Analysis and Reporting for a Retail Chain 🛍️

Phase 1: Data Collection and Database Setup
- Data Collection: Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and placed it on the right path.
- Database Setup: Designed a slick SQL database to house the data. Crafted the schema and summoned the tables into existence with SQL DDL commands.

Phase 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Data Cleaning: Used SQL queries and Python (pandas) to tidy up the data. Bade farewell to missing or inconsistent data and dealt with outliers like a data superhero.
- Data Preparation: Cooked up the data for analysis, creating new fields and sprinkling in some Python magic.

Phase 3: Data Analysis
-Data Exploration: Set sail on the sea of data, navigating with SQL queries and Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn). Unveiled trends and patterns like a modern-day data detective.
- Advanced Analysis: Went beyond the basics with time series analysis and cohort analysis using Python's advanced data analysis libraries.

 Phase 4: Reporting
- Report Preparation: Crafted stunning reports with tabular and visual delights. SQL queries and Python did the heavy lifting, while Excel and I played a duet.
- Report Presentation: Shone the spotlight on my findings through an Excel dashboard and, of course, a presentation to make the data dance!
